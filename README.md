# BlogParser

## About

This project was fueled by the lack of fast internet and small data plans that people in rural communities in the US and less developed nations experience. If a remote server could do the heavy lifting and take care of loading the webpage and parsing it for information, the load times would be much faster and use far less data.

With BlogParser, my server will load any requested page and attempt to identify the title and content and then send that information to the client. This can be done through the Electron powered desktop app in this repo, with the Chrome extension in the chrome/ directory or the viewer.py command line viewer. All of them are full featured and immediately ready.
